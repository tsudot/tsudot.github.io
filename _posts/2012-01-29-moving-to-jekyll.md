When I first heard about domains getting moved to namecheap as GoDaddy was in support for SOPA, I wanted to do the same. But for truck loads of work and lack of time, I have been dragging that thought up till now.

I'll also be moving out of wordpress which has become more than just a blog nowadays. Most of my content will be hosted on github. The experiment begins.
