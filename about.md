Hey there! I've been tinkering around with computers since 2005, turning what started as a curiosity into a full-blown career. I'm a programmer who believes in getting my hands dirty in multiple languages. I usually [code](https://github.com/tsudot) in Python and Go, and recently with the help of Sonnet, I can write JS and build user interfaces.

## Professional Adventures

I joined [Plivo](https://plivo.com) in early 2012, where I wore many hats - building SIP servers for scale, contributing to core telephony APIs, creating an in-house server metric graphing system, and building the Plivo iOS SDK.

I've always had a thing for solving complex problems, especially around tooling to deliver software and providing visibility into the entire process.

Most recently, I've been working on building the observability platform for an e-commerce mogul in Vancouver. This has been an exciting challenge navigating through tech and collaborating with multiple internal engineering teams to build a product for them.

## The Tech & The Human

I previously led the platform engineering team at an ecommerce builder platform - Lummo. I was responsible for uptime, continous delivery and scalability of the platform.

Let's connect and build something awesome together!
