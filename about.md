I am a programmer who believes in getting my hands dirty in multiple languages. I usually [code](https://github.com/tsudot) in python and currently fascinated by Go. 

I joined [Plivo](https://plivo.com) in early 2012. Since then I've worked on multiple tools and products. I've configured SIP servers, contributed to some of the core APIs in the product, created an in-house server metric graphing system. Toyed around with monitoring tools, wrote a layer to handle SIP registrations over RTMP and created the Plivo iOS SDK.

I call myself a generalist with deep interest in manga and guitar solos.
